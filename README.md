# HERD 🧠🐑  
**Hebbian Enhanced Route Decider**

HERD is a research project exploring how biologically inspired learning mechanisms—specifically Hebbian learning—can be applied to multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems. The project investigates how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can enable agents to learn optimal paths in a shared environment through local interactions and self-organization.

## 🧬 Project Overview

HERD leverages Hebbian learning principles to allow agents to adapt their pathfinding strategies based on experience. By simulating environments where agents must navigate to targets without collisions, HERD demonstrates how simple learning rules can lead to complex, coordinated behaviors.
